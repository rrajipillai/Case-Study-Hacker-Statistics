   # Case Study : Hacker-Statistics

Simulate the **Die Rolling Game** in the Empire State Building.

Used Hacker Statistics to calculate the chances of winning a bet. 

Used random number generators, loops, and Matplotlib to gain a competitive edge!

**Game Rules :**
* If dice is 1 or 2, go one step down.
* If dice is 3, 4 or 5, go one step up.
